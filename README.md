Welcome to **Health Companion**—your personal health assistant! This application leverages computer vision, machine learning, and interactive visualizations to provide health analysis, data predictions, and more. Let's take a closer look at what this app can do for you!

## 🚀 Features

1. **Health Analysis by Computer Vision**  
   Perform advanced health analysis using computer vision techniques.
   
2. **Sales Data Prediction**  
   Use machine learning to predict sales trends based on historical data.
   
3. **Patient Visualization**  
   Visualize and track patient health data in a simple and clear format.
   
4. **Medical Records**  
   Access, manage, and visualize medical records easily.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Streamlit** for the user interface
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for machine learning models
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** for creating interactive graphs
- **Google Sheets API** for reading and writing data
- **Scikit-learn** for predictive analytics

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-companion.git
   cd health-companion
   ```

2. **Important**: Decompress the `model.zip` file to get the `model.h5` file:

   Since the model file (`model.h5`) exceeds 25MB, it's provided as `model.zip`. Please unzip it and place the `model.h5` file in your repository before running the app:

   ```bash
   unzip model.zip -d ./models
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app1.py
   ```

   The app should now be running on `http://localhost:8501`.
